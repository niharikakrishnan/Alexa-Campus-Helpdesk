# Alexa-Campus-Helpdesk
Built a voice interactive skill for Alexa-enabled devices that can be deployed at various campus locations to serve as a repository of information for each campus locale

Utilized Amazonâ€™s Alexa SDK along with NodeJS programming language and AWS lambda function in the cloud to
convert natural language to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) which yielded a very human-like conversation with user

Experimental tests demonstrated an accurate and cost-effective helpdesk that minimizes human effort
